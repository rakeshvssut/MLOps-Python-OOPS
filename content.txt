1. Class and Object (Example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code Walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Pythod is called OOP? - Everything in python is a bject(data structure , data type etc)
4. Advantages of Oops concept
    > We can create our own data types
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end project  (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation # Hiding the attribute 
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why Inheritance is needed ? (Code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets inherited? (Constructor, Non private attribute, Non Private Methods)
    > Constructor overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword(It can be use only inside the class, Cannot access varriables/attributes, used only inside child class)
